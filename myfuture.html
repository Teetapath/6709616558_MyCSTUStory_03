            In the next four years of university, I want to grow, learn, and make lasting connections. I’m excited to dive into my studies, build skills for my future career, and meet people who inspire me. Along the way, I hope to explore new experiences whether through clubs, internships, or maybe even studying abroadwhile enjoying the ride and figuring out who I am.
